# Nasa-Astroidclassification

The Objective of this model is to predict whether the particular asteroid is hazardous to Earth or not based on a specific parameter that is available in the dataset. This dataset compiles the list of NASA-certified asteroids that are classified as the nearest Earth object


Steps:
1. Importing   basic libraries
2. EDA (exploratory data analysis)
3. Panda’s profiling 
4. Feature engineering 
5. Splitting the data into train and test
6. Performance metrics
7.Model building  
•	Logistic regression
•	Decision tree
•	Random forest
